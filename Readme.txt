In this project we were intended to work with statistical analysis adn hypothesis testing.
I chose to develop a product using the Naive Bayes classifier.

- VINTED APP CASE STUDY -

I did a case study for the Vinted app, second hand ecommerce platform. This product is called
'Profile my customer', a tool that companies like Vinted can use to profile their
users and see if they are potential sellers, buyers or users of the app.

The steps i followed to complete this projects where:

1 - Initial survey regarding the use of the second hand ecommerce platforms, received 126
answers from people in 23 different countries (Asia, Europe and America). 
- Survey can be found here: https://forms.gle/4xPK56KyVtCcj5ji9

2 - Treated the data, cleaned it, got some insights from it and encoded the categorical
answers into binary answers (0, 1).

3 - Developed the Naive bayes classifier, tested the performance and implemented it into the 
product.

4 - Built the product.

The end product is a program that receives an input of information (age, annual income, earnings
selling second hand products, motivations, etc.). With all that information, the algorithm is able
to predict the frequency of selling and frequency of buying of the user and also if it is 
a potential user of the Vinted app.
