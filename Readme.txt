In this project, the scope was to work with statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
I chose to develop a product using the Naive Bayes classifier.

- VINTED APP CASE STUDY -

I did a case study for the Vinted app, a second-hand eCommerce platform. This product is called
'Profile my customer', a tool that companies like Vinted can use to profile their
users and see if they are potential sellers, buyers, or users of the app.

The steps I followed to complete this project were:

1 - Initial survey regarding the use of the second-hand eCommerce platforms, received 126
answers from people in 23 different countries (Asia, Europe, and America). 
- Survey can be found here: https://forms.gle/4xPK56KyVtCcj5ji9

2 - Treated the data, cleaned it, got some insights from it, and encoded the categorical
answers into binary answers (0, 1).

3 - Developed the Naive Bayes classifier, tested the performance, and implemented it into the 
product.

4 - Built the product.

The end product is a program that receives an input of information (age, annual income, earnings
selling second-hand products, motivations, etc.). With all that information, the algorithm can 
predict the frequency of selling and frequency of buying of the user and also if it is 
a potential user of the Vinted app.
